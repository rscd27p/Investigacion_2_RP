    "\n",
    "Using the right metrics to evaluate an algorithms is key to evaluate their efectivity and have a common ground to compare multiple type of models. The information related to this metric was extracted from this two documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[1]$[20 Popular Machine Learning Metrics. Part 1: Classification & Regression Evaluation Metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/20-popular-machine-learning-metrics-part-1-classification-regression-evaluation-metrics-1ca3e282a2ce) by [Shervin Minaee](https://sites.google.com/site/shervinminaee/home), who is a Machine Learning Researcher that holds a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science.\n",

    "\n",
    "$[3]$[Accuracy, Precision, Recall or F1?](https://towardsdatascience.com/accuracy-precision-recall-or-f1-331fb37c5cb9) by [Koo Ping Shung](https://koopingshung.com/about/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1- Classification Accuracy (Used)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both articles agree that is a simple metric that allows to keep track of the **ratio of correct predictions**. This is represented by the equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Accurracy = \\frac{Number of Correct Predictions}{Total Number of Predictions Made} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on **$[1]$** there is a caveat when using it with samples that belong two different classes. For example, Lets asume that we have two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Class A.<br/>\n",
    "2-Class B.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use 98% of elements of Class A and 2% of Class B in our training set, its possible to get a training accurracy of up to 98%. However, if we use 60% of elements from Class A, and 40% from Class B. We can get a value of up to 60% accuracy, which is a good result. However this does not mean that the system is going to recognize a 100% of the samples all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2- Logarithmic Loss (Used)\n",
    "\n",
    "The logaritmic loss ir _log loss_ is used to penalize missclassifications.This works particularly well with multi-class classification algorithms. When using this metric, the classifier must assign a probability for an element belonging to each class for all the samples. The _log loss_ is represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ LogaritmicLoss = \\frac{-1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{M} y_{ij} * log(p_{ij}) $ <br/><br/>\n",
    "$ N: Samples belonging to M classes $ <br/><br/>\n",
    "$ M: Classes $ <br/><br/>\n",
    "$ y_{ij} indicates the probability that sample i belongs to class j or not$ <br/><br/>\n",
    "$ p_{ij} indicates the probability that sample i belongs to class j$ <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The log loss does not have an upper bound so it means and could have any value from zero to + infinity. The lower the value is to zero the higher is the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3- Confusion Metric (Used)\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix provides a summary of the performance of the whole model. It is easier to use an example to explain it. Lets assume there is a group of 1000 samples that could either be classified as **YES** or **NO**. (This example is adapted from $[2]$).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4- F1 Score (Used)\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1 Score** is a combination of two metrics named:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Precision**: Based on $ [2] $ there are many situations in which the use of the _classification accurancy_ is not a good indicator of performance. For example, in cases where there are multi-class datasets and that there is imbalance, just like in the case of the dataset being used.The idea behind is to create a class-related metric, due to that it has to be done for each class independently and it is define by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Precision = \\frac{True\\_Positive}{True\\_Positive + False\\_Positive} $<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above uses the terms higlighed in the confusion matrix below:\n",
    "\n",

    "|        Actual NO       \t|  True Negative \t| <span style=\"color: red\">**False Positive**</span> \t|\n",
    "|       Actual YES       \t| False Negative \t|  <span style=\"color: red\">**True Positive**</span>.\t|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Recall**: it is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all the relevant samples $[1]$. It is define by the following equation:\n",
    " \n",
    "$ Recall = \\frac{True\\_Positive}{True\\_Positive + False\\_Positive} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above uses the terms higlighed in the confusion matrix below:\n",

    "|        Actual NO       \t|  True Negative \t| False Positive \t|\n",
    "|       Actual YES       \t| <span style=\"color: blue\">**False Negative**</span> \t|  <span style=\"color: blue\">**True Positive**</span>.\t|\n",
    " \n",
    " <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for the F1 Score is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F1 = 2 * \\frac{Precision*Recall}{Precision+Recall} $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Precision, Recall and F1 are values between $[0:1]$ that could be represented by percentages by multipying them by a 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5- Specificity or Specificity (Used)\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric uses the data from the:\n",
